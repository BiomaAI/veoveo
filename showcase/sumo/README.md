# SUMO Traffic-World Showcase

The platform on a real simulator. [SUMO](https://eclipse.dev/sumo/) runs a live
traffic world; a task-native Python MCP server owns the one TraCI connection,
**pushes** the world into the Recording Hub as typed Rerun streams, and exposes
SUMO control as governed `sumo__*` tools — the long operations as MCP tasks the
agent detaches from and wakes on. SUMO is just another hub producer; the hub
never pulls.

## The scenario: LuST (real Luxembourg)

The SUMO container runs [**LuST — Luxembourg SUMO Traffic**](https://github.com/lcodeca/LuSTScenario)
(MIT): a validated OpenStreetMap network of Luxembourg City with a full day of
realistic demand and actuated signals, started at the morning ramp (07:00). Because
the network is geo-referenced, vehicle positions convert to true lat/lon and land on
the actual streets — `sumo-mcp` fits the cartesian→lon/lat map once as a full 2D
affine (rotation-aware, so cars sit squarely on the streets), then reads all vehicles
per frame in a single TraCI subscription round-trip.

### Two views from one frame

Each frame publishes complementary layers under `/world/sumo/**`:

- **Map view** — vehicles as one `GeoPoints` cloud on the real Luxembourg tiles,
  plus a batched `GeoLineStrings` **facing chevron** per vehicle showing heading.
- **3D view** — vehicles as oriented `Boxes3D` sized to their real footprint
  (a bus is long and tall, a car small — vehicle class carried in silhouette),
  yawed to their heading, over the road network drawn **once** as static
  `LineStrips3D`.

Speed is colour-coded on both on a **red → amber → green** ramp weighted toward the
jam end, so stopped and crawling traffic stays vividly red. The subscription carries
position, speed, road, heading, footprint, and vehicle class in one round-trip; every
layer is a single batched log call, so a dense city stays smooth. `SUMO_DRAW_NETWORK=0`
skips the one-time network fetch if you want the fastest possible startup.

## What the agent controls

- **Read** — `query_state` (every vehicle's geo position + speed, signals, mean speed), `describe_scenario`
- **Act** — `set_signal_phase`, `reroute_vehicle`, `set_edge_speed` (variable-speed sign), `close_lane` / `open_lane` (model an incident)
- **Time** — `run_batch` (fast-forward, as a detachable MCP task) — the sleep/wake op
- **Wake** — subscribe `sim://congestion`; a jam pushes `resources/updated`
- **Offline** — `generate_network` / `compute_routes` / `optimize_signals` shell out to the real SUMO CLIs (netgenerate / duarouter / tlsCoordinator)

## Visualize it live

```bash
docker compose -f compose.yaml -f showcase/sumo/compose.showcase.yaml \
    --profile hub --profile showcase up -d --build
# then attach a native Rerun viewer to the hub's live proxy on your machine:
rerun --port auto "rerun+http://127.0.0.1:9877/proxy"
```

Cars appear moving on the Luxembourg map, coloured red (congested) → green
(free-flowing), each with a facing chevron. The viewer auto-creates both a Map view
and a 3D view from the data — arrange them side by side to watch the same traffic as
oriented boxes over the road network.

## Why Python, and why our own server

The overwhelming majority of MCP servers are Python, so the showcase
demonstrates a *proper* one: task-native, streamable-HTTP, strongly typed with
pydantic. The public SUMO MCP servers are inspiration only — we rebuild the
taxonomy on the SDK's lowlevel server to get the **task API** (the long ops
return `CreateTaskResult`; the client detaches, polls, and reads the terminal
result — the exact sleep/wake path the agent kernel drives), gateway
projection/auth, and resource subscriptions for wakes.

> The task API is pinned to `mcp==1.28.x` (the SEP-1686 line the workspace's
> Rust gateway/kernel speak) and isolated in `sumo_mcp/tasks_compat.py`, so the
> future migration to the SEP-2663 tasks extension is a localized change.

> ⚠️ Never use `HypaSMarty/SUMO-MCP-Server` — it is a malware lure. The
> functional inspiration is `XRDS76354/SUMO-MCP-Server` (arXiv 2506.03548).

## Layout

```
showcase/sumo/                  # this showcase (siblings can be added under showcase/)
  compose.showcase.yaml         # sumo + sumo-mcp, layered on the hub profile
  compose.interim.yaml          # fake-driver runtime, no SUMO image (interim proof)
  sim/Dockerfile                # headless SUMO + LuST scenario, TraCI :8813
  mcp/                          # the Python server (package veoveo-sumo-mcp)
    src/sumo_mcp/
      sim_driver.py             # SimDriver protocol; Fake (tests) + Traci (live)
      tools.py                  # pydantic-typed tools; single-owner serialization
      tasks_compat.py           # the SEP-1686 task seam
      server.py                 # lowlevel MCP server: sync + task tools + resources
      streams.py                # push path: /world/sumo/** → hub (map + 3D layers)
      push.py                   # sumo-sim: standalone push loop
      runtime.py                # container entry: own TraCI + push + serve
      resources.py              # congestion watch condition
    tests/                      # unit tests, fake driver, no SUMO needed
    scripts/sumo_push_smoke.sh  # S0 push spine smoke (invoked by `just smoke-sumo-push`)
  scripts/
    showcase_capstone.sh        # live e2e (invoked by `just showcase-capstone`)
    capstone_client.py          # the MCP client the capstone drives
```

Task entry points live in the root `Justfile` (`just test-sumo-mcp`,
`smoke-sumo-push`, `showcase-up`, `showcase-capstone`); the heavier smoke and
capstone orchestration stay as scripts the recipes invoke.

## Run it

Tests (no SUMO needed — fake driver):

```bash
just test-sumo-mcp
```

Push spine against the real Rust hub (no SUMO needed — fake driver pushes,
the hub captures and QueryEngine reads back):

```bash
just smoke-sumo-push
```

Full live stack (SUMO + sumo-mcp + hub, Docker):

```bash
docker compose -f compose.yaml -f showcase/sumo/compose.showcase.yaml \
    --profile hub --profile showcase up --build
# SUMO drives traffic; sumo-mcp pushes /world/sumo/** into the hub and serves
# sumo__* on 127.0.0.1:8795. Query the world via the hub catalog.
```

## The loop it demonstrates

SUMO streams the world into the hub → the agent reads its world model → calls a
task tool (`run_batch`, `optimize_signals`), **detaches and sleeps** → wakes on
the task result → acts (`set_signal_phase`, `reroute_vehicle`) → a
`sim://congestion` resource update wakes the next episode. Every arrow is
machinery that now exists.
